# Quick-Share
A quick and dirty file upload to the file share service transfer.sh

# Read-Me
This is part of a larger application written for an end of year project for my Linux scripting course. A simple script that uses Curl to upload files to Transfer.sh, with options to randomize the filename.
The last URL upload is preserved under the title name.

# To-Do
Add a check to determine if Curl is installed.
